# QrMusic
A program that reads a specific file extension in a qr code and converts it into midi


# Progress
The program can read a file and compress it in a .cmi format. Then it can read the cmi file and turn it back to .mid, and it'll mostly convert it right, except for time issues. It only works for 1 instrument, and it currently has a compression of x0.5 the origial.
